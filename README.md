# Ad-Campaign-Analysis
# Problem Statement:
Globalshala is running Facebook ad campaigns to promote its “Super-U” program. However, despite consistent ad spending, there is a lack of clarity on which campaigns are underperforming in terms of reach, engagement, and conversions. The objective is to analyze campaign-level performance data to identify ads that are not suitable or productive, and provide actionable insights to optimize future campaign strategy and improve return on investment (ROI).
